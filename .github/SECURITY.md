## Reporting a Bug

The Members of the RedEyed Software Guild and community take all bugs very seriously.  We know all too well how much damage even the most inane of bugs can cause if exploited by those with ill-intent.  Because of the seriousness of these matters, we very much appreciate your efforts and your responsible disclosure, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report all bugs using the [Issue Tracker][tracker]

When reporting a bug, the following is some of the information you might think to include:

- The website, page or repository where the bug may be observed
- A brief description of the bug
- Optionally, the type of vulnerability and OWASP Category, if applicable
- Non-destructive exploit details

Your submission will be acknowledged within 48 hours, and a more detailed response will follow which indicates our next steps in handling your report.  After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavour to keep you informed of the progress of the fix and the timing of the full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please report bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining that module.  It is neither within our power or our purview to fix bugs in code that we are not responsible for maintaining.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a bug report, it is assigned to a primary handler.  This person will coordinate the fix and release process, and this involves the following steps:

- Confirm the bug and determine the affected versions
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems
- Prepare fixes for all released still under maintenance

## Scope of Policy

The following are NOT in the scope of this policy:

- volumetric vulnerabilities - for example, overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests.
- reports indicating that our services do not fully align with 'best practices' according to one body or another.

## A Word About "Bug Bounties"

Unfortunately, RedEyed-RPG does not offer a paid "Bug Bounty" program - the main reason being that I'm just one bloke on his own trying to make a living here. If I suddenly happen to strike it rich, this may change - until then, we (being myself and the community surrounding this project) will make every effort to show our appreciation to the people who take the time and effort to expose vulnerabilities in our code responsibly, and reserve our everlasting disdain for those who do otherwise - including those holding out such information in the hope of obtaining monetary reward. We believe it is ENTIRELY in opposition to the fundamental principles of open-source software for this sort of practice to be engaged in and will not be backwards about coming forwards in telling anyone who enquires about such exactly when they can expect to receive their "Bug Bounty".

## Security Advisories

We will pass on to consumers of our products, any and all security advisories that we may receive with regard to any third-party application that is distributed as part of this project in a timely manner, and will attempt to do the same with any patches and upgrades which may follow as a result of an advisory we've received. If the vulnerability is severe enough, and a patch or upgrade does not appear to be on its way from the maintainer of the package(s) involved, we will not hesitate to remove that package from our distribution and either replace it immediately, or do without until a suitable replacement can be found.

At no point will we - through neglect or omission - put the security of our consumer's devices at risk in favour of saving face. We will be frank and honest with regard to the extend and severity of all security incidents as news of them comes to hand, and this will remain a primary concern for us until the day we cease operations.

## Comments on this Policy

If you've got any comments on how this policy might be improved, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
